### **Encrypted-VPN-IoT **
• Setting up an Encrypted VPN channelled infrastructure for IoT.  

The proposed system also aims in building up three models 

• A local MQTT server setup on a Raspberry-Pi. 

• A cloud MQTT server. 

• An Hybrid model in which higher order(in terms of processing speed and complexity) requests to be processed on the Raspberry-Pi and the requests with less overhead on the cloud.  


### **The project aims in :** 

• Securing IoT M2M communication 

• Bringing in standardization of security principles to be implemented 

• Authentication of the clients participating in the communication 

• Building Cost effective security 

• Establishing a standalone executable model on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and IOS 

• Supporting simultaneous users 

• Providing Network access control - Authenticating a client-side digital certificate
